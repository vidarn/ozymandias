=== Ozymandias TODO ===
-- Core --
- Better RNG
- Multithreading
    - Windows
    - Linux
- Convert to c using clang extensions
    - Use extended vector
- Enable floating point exceptions
    - Disable before calling embree functions
* Add macro for pure/const functions
* Check gamma correction
* Unify scene with embree scene
* Split file format into scene + take?

-- Features --
* Render in buckets
* Low discrepancy samples
* Tonemapping
* Multiple importance sampling
* UV data
* Bump/normal mapping
    * Better tangent directions
* Subdivision surfaces

-- Bugs --
- -NAN with phong BRDF
- Light sources look dark in reflections
- There's a bug in the direct ligthing code. Adding another emitter dims the current one.. or something like that...
- Heavy geometry crash in light_sample?
* There's a lot of banding somewhere, visible in reflective plane with fresnel 1.6
* Corners of phong sphere are a bit dark...
    * Could just be the poor sampling, perhaps we reject all of the samples...

-- Documentation --
* Clean up current documentation

-- BRDF --
- Parameters to BRDF's
* GGX (with documentation?)
* Mix BRDF

-- Exporter --
- Fix rotations
* Read sample count and resolution from scene file
* Progressive rendering
* Load library in python to avoid going through the hard drive
* Material previews

-- Libraries --
- PCG
* OpenShadingLanguage
* OpenColorIO
* OpenSubdiv?
* OpenImageIO?

-- GUI --
* Refine standalone GUI?
* Use websockets + javascript?
* Material editor
