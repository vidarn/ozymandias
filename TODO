=== Ozymandias TODO ===
-- Core --
- Better RNG
- Multithreading
    - Windows
    - Linux
- Convert to c using clang extensions
    - Use extended vector
- Enable floating point exceptions
    - Disable before calling embree functions
- Check gamma correction
- Add macro for pure/const functions?
- Split into lib + app
- Split file format into scene + shot
* Unify scene with embree scene
* Read command line arguments
* Better handling of binary data, using protobuf?

-- Features --
- Passes
- Render in buckets
    - Hilbert curve
    * Better sequence, specify bucket size instead of count
* UV data
* Baking
* Bump/normal mapping
    - Better tangent directions
* Low discrepancy samples
* Tonemapping
* Multiple importance sampling
* Subdivision surfaces
* Parametric scene for material previews?
    * Check if it would mean a speedup? Perhaps faster to just raytrace normaly?

-- Bugs --
- -NAN with phong BRDF
- Light sources look dark in reflections
- There's a bug in the direct ligthing code. Adding another emitter dims the current one.. or something like that...
- Heavy geometry crash in light_sample?
* There's a lot of banding somewhere, visible in reflective plane with fresnel 1.6
* Corners of phong sphere are a bit dark...
    * Could just be the poor sampling, perhaps we reject all of the samples...

-- Documentation --
* Clean up current documentation

-- BRDF --
- Parameters to BRDF's
* GGX (with documentation?)
* Mix BRDF

-- Exporter --
- Fix rotations
* Read sample count and resolution from scene file
* Progressive rendering
* Material previews

-- Libraries --
- PCG
* OpenShadingLanguage
* OpenColorIO
* OpenSubdiv?
* OpenImageIO?

-- GUI --
* Refine standalone GUI?
* Use websockets + javascript?
* Material editor
